  <p>Hey there!</p>

<p>Yeah, I missed a week. I was prepping for my Physiology Exam, and I’m feeling pretty confident about it :D</p>

<p>So, to make up for my late response, here’s two weeks of content. The things I found interesting, and the things that have helped me grow my understanding.</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="immunology--infection">Immunology &amp; Infection</h1>
<h2 id="week-5---infection-control">Week 5 - Infection Control</h2>
<p>How do we control Infections?
Through a few methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sterilisation, and</li>
  <li>Disinfection.
Look, I coul get into, “Oh, what are the different types of these techniques?” or, “Describe the process of how an Autoclave performs Heat Sterilisation?”</li>
</ul>

<p>But I honestly can’t be fucked, I just finished writing the Week 5 portion on Muscle Contraction and honestly, there’s too many different methods we’ve utilised to kill Microbes. So, yeah~~ :)))</p>

<h2 id="week-6---epidemiology--disease-processes">Week 6 - Epidemiology &amp; Disease Processes</h2>
<p>This is a really fascinating topic.</p>

<p>Ok, so, how do we control Infectious Disease Outbreaks?</p>

<p>We Sterilise, and we Disinfect.
We Observe, we Isolate, and we Quarantine.
We look out for symptoms, we manage Pathogenic Transmissions, keep an eye out for Reservoirs, and collect data on time of origin.</p>

<p>It’s a whole thing.</p>

<h1 id="phyiology---muscular-system">Phyiology - Muscular System</h1>
<h2 id="week-5---muscular-system">Week 5 - Muscular System</h2>
<p><strong>Seemingly Simple Question</strong>: How do Muscles Contract?</p>

<p><strong>Seemingly Simple Answer</strong>: Motor Neurons stimulate the Muscle Fibers, causing the individual Muscle Cells to Contract :D</p>

<p><strong>Actual Answer</strong>: <strong><em>SCREAMS</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Actual Actual Answer</strong>: Neurons do indeed stimulate the Muscle Cells (Myocytes) to contract, but what acutally <em>causes</em> the contraction is a really interesting piece physiology. The Neuron sends Acetylcholine (AcH) across the Synaptic Cleft, binding to AcH Receptors on the Motor End Plate on the Myocyte. The Motor End Plate and the Axon Terminals that form the communication is called a Neuromuscular Junction.</p>

<p>When AcH binds to an AcH Receptor, it opens an Ion Channel that allows Sodium to enter into the Myocyte, and allows Potassium to leave. If enough Ion Channels are opened near the Motor End Plate, an Action Potential sweeps across the Myocyte. This Action Potential causes the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR; an organelle within the Myocyte) to release Calcium Ions.</p>

<p>Calcium is really important for the next steps.</p>

<p>The release of Calcium into the Sarcoplasm (the Myocytes Cytoplasm) causes an interaction with the Myofibrils. A Myofibril is an Organelle found within Myocytes. These Organelles are the entities that contract the cell. A myofibril is made of three Myofilaments: Thin Myofilaments, Thick Myofilaments, and Elastic Myofilaments. When Calcum is released, it binds to Troponin (a Protein that is found on the Thin Myofilament) which moves Tropomyosin (another Protein found on Thin Myofilaments), allowing a part of the Thick Myofilament to bind to the Thin Myofilament. This portion of the Thick Myofilament, once ATP (Cellular Energy) comes into contact with it, moves the Thin Myofilament towards the centre of the Thick Myofilament.</p>

<p>This ‘Slide’ of the Thin Myofilament is Muscle Contraction.</p>

<p>To deactivate this Slide, ATP must come into contact with the Thick Myofilament portion again to release the Thin Myofilament, and Calcium needs to be returned to the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. From there, Elastic Myofilaments push the Thick Myofilaments and Thin Myofilaments away, returning the Myofibril to its initial state.</p>

<p>Yay! :D</p>

<p>==tl;dr==: Sliding Filament Theory and Cross Bridge Theory is really fascinating, but it’s also batshit crazy.</p>
<h2 id="week-6---exam-revision">Week 6 - Exam Revision</h2>
<p>Spent this time just memorising the above, the Endocrine System, and a lot of stuff i hadn’t memorised with the Nervous System xD</p>

<p>Honestly, I need to keep up with my flashcards so I’m prepped and ready for the final exam.</p>

<p>But, there’s just so much content DDDD:</p>

<h2 id="anywho-did-my-exam-feeling-pretty-good-about-it-lets-move-on">Anywho! Did my exam, feeling pretty good about it, let’s move on!</h2>
<h1 id="statistics">Statistics</h1>
<h2 id="week-5---data-types-and-visualisations">Week 5 - Data Types and Visualisations</h2>
<p>It was fascinating going through different categories of data, and what the best visualisation is for each one. I was taught about Discrete and Continuous Variables back in highschool, but to see them further broken down into their subsets was cool.</p>

<p>And of course, for different types of data, there are appropriate and inappropriate representations of that data. Line graphs are better with time, histograms are only really relevant with Continuous Data, and Column Graphs are better with Categorical.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, I could/should say that certain Visualisations should only be used with certain Data Types, I get that. But, they <em>can</em> be used - although extremely poorly - in situations that don’t call for them. Anyway, it’s all fascinating, it’s all statistics :P</p>
  <h2 id="week-6---probability-distributions">Week 6 - Probability Distributions</h2>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="rest-of-semester">Rest of Semester</h2>
<p>For the rest of semester, we’re looking at Hypothesis Testing and Computational Software.
