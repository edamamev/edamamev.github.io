<p>AH</p>

<p>ok</p>

<p>So, I would love to touch on this in my Week 4 Update, but, I really want to get this out of my system now because my brain is just filled to the brim with stuff on the Endocrine System.</p>

<p>So, here’s the Endocrine System.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="what-is-the-endocrine-system">What is the Endocrine System?</h2>
<p>An organ system that is responsible for chemical signalling within the body through the secretion of hormones.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-hormones">What are Hormones?</h2>
<p>Chemical signals to communicate with Organs of the body, including other Endocrine Organs.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-just-use-the-nervous-system">Why not just use the Nervous System?</h2>
<p>Well, here’s where the core difference between the two systems come to light:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Nervous System acts almost instantaneously, making it better for quick and timely communication.</li>
  <li>The Endocrine System is reliant on chemical transmission through the blood, making it better for slower and (typically) less time critical situations.</li>
</ul>

<p>This key difference is why the Endocrine System has quite a lot to do with regulating Homeostasis, because it can impact more gradual changes in the body (such as Blood Glucose Levels, Blood Fat Levels, and Blood Water Levels (Osmolality)) in a ??</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="the-flow">The Flow</h2>
<p>Am I going to get into the entire flow of the Endocrine System in this blog post? Absolutely not. BUT, I did spend a long time creating a canvas page using Obsidian so I can better visualise the flow of Hormones throughout the body.
So, voila!</p>

  <p>Did you just make this blog post so you could post your endocrine diagram online to show off?</p>

<p>…
Maybe a little bit.</p>

<p>COME ON it looks good!</p>

<p>I like it, and I’m proud of it :D</p>

<p>Look, it’s low fidelity, and quite frankly I need to get back to studying soon. So, I’m gonna leave this here.</p>
