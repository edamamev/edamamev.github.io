  <p>SO</p>

<p>WEEK 4</p>

<p>Good lord this semester is moving fast.</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="immunology">Immunology</h1>
<p>Bacteriology is the name of the game.</p>

<p>What is Bacteria? What kinda things are in Bacteria? Plasmids? Nucleoids? oooo maybe the Peptidoglycan Layer?! Yep! All of this and more were researched this week.</p>

<p>Honestly, I have written up all of my flashcards, but I’ve barely look at them xD
I’m gonna get on that, we have a mid semester exam coming up in Week 7 that is based on the first 6 weeks of content for the unit, so <strong>will</strong> get onto it.</p>

<p>But, not too bad so far, learnt how to Gram Stain, go to do that with E. coli in the lab. Gotta see pretty pink colours.</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="physiology">Physiology</h1>
<p>As per last post, yeah. The Endocrine System.</p>

<p>Look, it really isn’t that complicated, it’s just a lot to memorise.</p>

<p>And memorise I did.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Or at least what was in the curriculum, I know it’s <em>far</em> more intricate than what they squashed into one week.</p>

<p>But I’m still happy with how it’s going :D</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="stats">Stats</h1>
<p>Now we do have an exam on Friday, but I’m not too stressed.</p>

<p>It’s just revision maths content: Logarithms, Exponentials, Algebra, Simultaneous Equations and so on, so I’m gonna do some revision on Thursday then get into it.</p>

<p>As for content, we’re actually getting into Stats and Experimental Design!!!</p>

<p>Sampling Error, Sampling Biases, Sampling Methods, and different types of Variables!!!</p>

<p>I’m really excited for where this unit’s going to go, and I’m feeling pretty confident with the content so far.</p>

<hr />
<p>So there we go! I uh, think the D&amp;D Campaign Companion project I wanted to work on is going to be delayed, cos some new things have popped up.</p>

<p>I recently got into  a discussion with a family member about the Referendum that’s coming up in Australia. And, I have been doing a lot of research into a lot of claims being made surrounding what this constitutional change represents, and what powers it provides.</p>

<p>I am for The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, but I want to release a post on here as to my reasoning behind my conclusion, just so I have it somewhere I guess, and it lets me redirect people to my blog if they want something to read :P</p>
