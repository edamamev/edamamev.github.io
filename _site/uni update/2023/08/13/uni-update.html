  <p>So. It’s Week 3 of my second semester into Biomedical Sciences.</p>

<p><strong>AND IM LOVING IT</strong></p>

<p>oml, ok, so it’s very content heavy. My intro to Physiology class took the building blocks of last sems Anatomy class and went:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Oh, you know what everything is? Fantastic! Now, let’s explore *how</em> all of it is done :D”*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and let me tell you, it’s a lot to keep track off.</p>

<p>I have so many Anki flashcards in my Nervous System deck ;-;</p>

<hr />
<p>OOOOO</p>

<p>and we’re also doing Infection and Immunity!</p>

<p>I really like this unit, we get to look at fungi in the lab, look at dead Hemlinths(worm parasites) in bottles, and I’m currently doing the content for Viruses and Prions.</p>

<p>ITS SO COOL</p>

<p>The science</p>

<p>Not what the infections do to people.</p>

<p>It’s really messed up.</p>

<p>…but it’s also cool from a technical perspective xD</p>

<hr />
<p>AND FINALLY</p>

<p>Stats for Health Scientists</p>

<p>Ok so, so far it’s not too bad, all it’s been so far has been a refresher on senior highschool maths.</p>

<p>But the actual <em>statistics</em> content will be in Week 4.</p>

<p>Look, I love math. It’s a happy place in my head, and data analysis has never been <em>too</em> bad. But, because it’s a unit dedicated to it, I’m excited and apprehensive because I’m not sure what to expect.</p>

<hr />
<p>So yeah that’s been this week, here’s to another one!</p>
