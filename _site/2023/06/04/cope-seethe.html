  <p>THE PROJECT!</p>

<p>So, have any ya’ll heard of D&amp;D?</p>

<p>I want to work on a D&amp;D Engine.</p>

<p>No, this isn’t like my <a href="https://github.com/edamame-v/GMCampaignManager">previous project</a>.</p>

<p>I mean, it is.</p>

<p>BUT IT’S DIFFERENT.</p>

<hr />

<p>The difference is, I have <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> as the main database that I use for my GMing space.
It’s easy to use, has some awesome features to make my version of worldbuilding make sense, and allows for quick data navigation.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, that’s only 1 part of what my original GM Campaign Manager set out to achieve.</p>

<p>The more I sat on the idea, the more I realised I could add a <em>SHIT TONNE</em> of worldbuilding automation.</p>

<p>AND AND AND, there’s the idea of a fantasy medieval economy, inspired by the supplement <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/13113/Grain-Into-Gold/">Grain Into Gold</a>.
I spent an <strong>ungodly</strong> amount of time converting a lot of the material into Obsidian notes, and I can use the data I’ve gathered to create a piece of software to…</p>

<p>Be my Worldbuilding Assistant.</p>

<p>NPC Generation, Town Generation, Income, and SO MUCH MORE. ITEM GENERATION. BOOK GENERATION. I WILL NEVER HAVE AN EMPTY LIBRARY IN A TOWER EVER AGAIN.</p>

<p><em>pants</em></p>

<p><em>breathes</em></p>

<p><em>exhales</em></p>

<p>With Obsidian doing all my heavy lifting, I can focus <em>entirely</em> on worldbuilding automation and economy.</p>

<p>So, I plan to work on that when i have time ^_^</p>
