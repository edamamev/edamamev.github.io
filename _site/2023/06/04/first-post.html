  <p>Set this site up! Really happy with how it’s turned out, took me the better part of the day, but it’s really worth it :D</p>

<p>I remember watching a video about having your own corner of the internet. Just, to be <em>yours</em>. It’s funny how this was how we viewed the internet when it was first made, but as it became increasingly crowded by corporations, our entire perspective on what the internet <em>was</em> began to shift.</p>

<p>We experienced it through entities instead of taking a part for ourselves.</p>

<hr />

<p>GRANTED, I am <strong>literally</strong> hosting this for free through <a href="www.github.com">Github</a>, so who am I to talk. But, it’s more fundamental than that. It’s having the understanding that you can make the internet <em>yours</em>. That it’s more than just corporate overextension in our spaces, that we can create our own spaces, and own it.</p>

<p>idk, just some thoughts before I call it for the night.</p>
