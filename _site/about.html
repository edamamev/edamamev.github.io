    <h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Ah! Welcome, welcome! Please, grab a seat, and make yourself at home. Allow me to regail you with my story:</p>

<h2 id="you-picked-a-bad-time-to-get-lost-friend">“You picked a bad time to get lost friend…”</h2>
<p>So heyyy~! I’m Edme (Ed-may), a student at the <a href="https://qut.edu.au">Queensland University of Technology</a> studying a Bachelor of Biomedical Sciences. I’ve loved computers since primary school, but want my career to be in the health industry.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>With IT pervading every aspect of most industries, I can imagine a future where I meet both in the middle. Could be a fun future ;)</p>

<p>Look fellas, I’m on the autism spectrum. So my brain is wired differently. Not better or worse, just different. As colleagues, you can expect the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reserved when working, I need to be doing work. I like feeling satisfied with my work.</li>
  <li>Gonna have niche interests I could talk at length for, but will likely listen and be interested in what’s happening in your life.</li>
  <li>I can get overwhelmed when there’s a lot happening all at once. This won’t often be a problem as I’ve learnt ways to cope, but after an absolute wreck of a day, the last thing I need is someone yelling at me. I will likely just stand there while my brain reboots :D</li>
</ul>

<p>So yeah! This page is gonna be occassionally updated when there’s more ‘Me Lore’ I want to share with the world, but until then, take a look at some <a href="https://edamame-v.github.io">blog posts!</a> Who knows what I’ve been up to, I sure as hell don’t.</p>

<p>Take care! And until next time,</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
