OK SO

I know that I said that I'd be working on the Worldbuilding Assistant.

And I will/have been.

HOWEVER

My partner has been working on this game called "Hailey's Aesop".

It's a text-based interactive narrative about a person trying to figure out their sexuality. It's a really fun, really engaging piecce of media that I co-authored!

So, yeah! That's what I've been up to recently, just helping her out with writing some scenes, endings, and just being a wall she can throw ideas at and maybe something useful will bounce back.

It's been really cool working with her, and maybe whoever is reading this will get a kick out of it too.

So that aside, my Worldbuilding Assistant is still in the Brainstorming phase.
Next post, I'll have a lot more to share about it.
However, I can share a few important details.
1. I've been looking into Ray Dalio's book on 'The Changing World Order' for a model of world powers and empire to create a better economic/political system. It's been under fire for not holding one of it's subjects to the same criteria as others, and is deemed as inaccurate, but I will be using his model for fantasy worldbuilding, so I hope it serves its job ok :D
2. I've been looking at how much data I want to store, how much I want to automate, and how I'm going to abstract the problem. Maybe looking into City Skylines 2 would be an idea, but I'm sure it's going to be a lot of reading up on simulation papers and trial and error.
3. I'm hopefully gonna produce a public progress report once a week, but as uni kicks back up, those updates may contain less and less. We'll see <3

So yeah! One project down, with another one on the horizon.
