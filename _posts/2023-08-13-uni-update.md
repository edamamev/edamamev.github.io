So. It's Week 3 of my second semester into Biomedical Sciences.

**AND IM LOVING IT**

oml, ok, so it's very content heavy. My intro to Physiology class took the building blocks of last sems Anatomy class and went:

> *"Oh, you know what everything is? Fantastic! Now, let's explore *how* all of it is done :D"*

and let me tell you, it's a lot to keep track off.

I have so many Anki flashcards in my Nervous System deck ;-;

OOOOO

and we're also doing Infection and Immunity!

I really like this unit, we get to look at fungi in the lab, look at dead Hemlinths(worm parasites) in bottles, and I'm currently doing the content for Viruses and Prions.

ITS SO COOL

The science

Not what the infections do to people.

It's really messed up.

...but it's also cool from a technical perspective xD

AND FINALLY

Stats for Health Scientists

Ok so, so far it's not too bad, all it's been so far has been a refresher on senior highschool maths.

But the actual *statistics* content will be in Week 4.

Look, I love math. It's a happy place in my head, and data analysis has never been *too* bad. But, because it's a unit dedicated to it, I'm excited and apprehensive because I'm not sure what to expect.
