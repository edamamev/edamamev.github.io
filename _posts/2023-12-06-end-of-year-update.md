Damn, this year has been interesting.

I got pretty slack with my posts when uni really ramped up, sorry about that.
I've since pushed the WIP posts because ytf not.


So!

Not sure if there are any CGP Grey fans reading this, but I'm running a ✨theme✨ over the summer!
> Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) for more details.

It is the "Summer of Reading", so my plan is to do at least 10 minutes of reading for the months of December, January, and February to try and get myself back into the habit of reading. I bought *so **many*** books in 2023, but never took the time to read many of them.

So, imma read em :D

I'm gonna post any insights or reviews of books over on my [cohost!](https://cohost.org/edamamev), so if you're interested consider following me over there.

I think...

cohost! will be where I do my hobby blogging, and here will be where I do my education/research blogging.

That could be pretty cool.

> ~~Watch me make a YT channel too in the future~~

Anywho! That's all for now.
