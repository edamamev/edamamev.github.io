Set this site up! Really happy with how it's turned out, took me the better part of the day, but it's really worth it :D

I remember watching a video about having your own corner of the internet. Just, to be *yours*. It's funny how this was how we viewed the internet when it was first made, but as it became increasingly crowded by corporations, our entire perspective on what the internet *was* began to shift.

We experienced it through entities instead of taking a part for ourselves.

GRANTED, I am **literally** hosting this for free through [Github](www.github.com), so who am I to talk. But, it's more fundamental than that. It's having the understanding that you can make the internet *yours*. That it's more than just corporate overextension in our spaces, that we can create our own spaces, and own it.

idk, just some thoughts before I call it for the night.
