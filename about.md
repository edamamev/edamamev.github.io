Ah! Welcome, welcome! Please, grab a seat, and make yourself at home. Allow me to regail you with my story:

## "It's a bad time to get lost friend..."
So heyyy~! I'm Edme (Ed-may), a student at the [Queensland University of Technology](https://qut.edu.au) studying a Bachelor of Biomedical Sciences. I've loved computers since primary school, but want my career to be in the health industry.
> With IT pervading every aspect of most industries, I can imagine a future where I meet both in the middle. Could be a fun future ;)

## Personality Jazz
Look fellas, I'm on the autism spectrum. So my brain is wired differently. Not better or worse, just different. As colleagues, you can expect the following:
- Reserved when working, I need to be doing work. I like feeling satisfied with my work.
- Gonna have niche interests I could talk at length for, but will likely listen and be interested in what's happening in your life.
- I can get overwhelmed when there's a lot happening all at once. This won't often be a problem as I've learnt ways to cope, but after an absolute wreck of a day, the last thing I need is someone yelling at me. I will likely just stand there while my brain reboots :D

## Socials

## In Closing...
So yeah! This page is gonna be occassionally updated when there's more 'Me Lore' I want to share with the world, but until then, take a look at some [blog posts!](https://edamame-v.github.io) Who knows what I've been up to, I sure as hell don't.

Take care, and until next time,

Cheers.
